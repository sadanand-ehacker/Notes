Hiding Identity ->
Proxy Servers -> Screenshot(9), It's hard to find the identity of a hacker, We can use Tor browser for this task, tor
actually transfers ur data or request from multiple proxies(proxy chain) which makes it difficult to trace back the real user.
Tor browser will only hide when u r browsing some website but not if u r using system it won't help u.

- Never Run tor as root user // actually tor won't allow u to run as root itself and it's better to use the system without root user
