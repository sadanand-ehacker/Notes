- Basic difference between Linux flavours is that Ubuntu or Debian based flavours use 'apt-get' and fedora or other same one
uses the 'yum'

# General cmds 

- ls        		// To list the files present in directory
- ls option_cmd directory_name      // syntax for ls cmd
- ls Documents          // this will list all the files which r in Documents directory
- ls -al                // this will show the hidden files and the details about all files
- ls -ltr		// to list every thing in timely reverse order 
- ls -li 		// to list the inodes 
- ls -sh		// to display size in human readble format

Note -> on doing cmd in home directory -> ls -ltr // u might see that the username and groupname for the user is same even after
changing it and the reason for that the actual group of the user will always remain the username it is just now part of the another
group to change it properly use the 

- mkdir directory_name // to create the directory

- rm filename                       // to remove a file
- rm -r parent_directory_name       // this will remove the file and the directory's also

- cp options_cmd src des        // 'cp' is used as copy command 'src' is the source from which we wants to copy and 'des' is
                                // the destination where we wants to copy
- cp file1 file2                // this will copy data of file1 to file2 and create file2 if it does not exist
- cp file1 dir1                 // this will copy file1 to dir1 directory

- mv options_cmd src des // syntax for mv
- mv file1 file2 // this will move data and rename file and directories so here file1 will be renamed as file2 and if file2
                 //  doesn't exist it will be created
- mv file1 dir1 // this will move file1 to dir1 directory and if file1 exists then the data in it will be overwritten
- mv -v file1 dir1      // for the verbose mode

Note -> If U get permission denied while listing of files with any command then use 'sudo' with that cmd

- cmd -> echo $SHELL , o/p -> the path to the shell which is being used

- cd /root/Desktop  // this navigation is also correct, no need to 1st execute cd ~ then go to Desktop
- ls /home/          // to know the users
- cd /home/username  // to navigate to userbased directory

- pwd       // This cmd shows the current working directory

- whoami // to find who is logged in the system at current
- visudo  /etc/sudoers  // it is to edit file which is configuration file that allows u to add or remove the rights to run cmds
  look for the string 'wheel' the users in this group can run all cmds -?? 
- hostname // It is used to obtain the DNS(Domain Name System) name and set the system's hostname or NIS(Network Information System)
  domain name. A hostname is a name which is given to a computer and it attached to the network. Its main purpose is to uniquely
  identify over a network.
- hostnamectrl -set-hostname newhostname // to change the hostname
  place where the changes r done for hostname -> /etc/hostname


- cat /etc/os-release // to get info of OS
- uname -a // for kernel info
- sudo dmidecode // to get proper and detailed info for the system


- history // to know the cmds executed
- !cmd_no. // the history cmd gives the cmd no. for the cmds we can use it's no. to execute the cmd
- path for the history cmds saved -> home/username/.bash_history


# User Account Management

- cat /etc/group // to list the groups
- cat /etc/shadow // it is for the password of the users we create it
- less /etc/passwd 	// to list the users and follow link to understand the logs ->
	https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-list-users-in-linux/

- 'passwd' cmd allows u to change the password for the user
- sudo passwd user_name // now u can change the password for the entered user if u enter username as root then it will
  change the password for root 

- 'sudo' cmd allows extra privilages as administrator or more then normal user
- 'sudo' infront of any cmd will enhance the privilage criteria for that cmd
- su - // to become root user
- su username // to change user

- Adding a New Non-Root User in Kali Linux -> https://thecrazybastard.com/how-to-add-a-new-user-in-kali-linux/

- 'userdel' cmd is used to delete the user
- sudo userdel user_name // it will delete the user but it will not delete the directory of the user which u can see by using          
  cmd -> ls /home/, Hence the user will be deleted but his data will not
- sudo userdel -r user_name   // this will delete the home directory also with the user
- sudo rm -r /home/mark/      // this will remove all the data of the user, So use it carefully

- 'useradd' cmd is used to create a user
- usermod -G groupname username // to change the group for a user
cmd imp -> useradd -g groupname -s /bin/bash -c "Description msg" -m -d /home/username username // this cmd will done the all work
together mostly used in IT by system admin to add user
    // -m is going to create a default home directory for this
    // user, -s is used for allowing the user to use the shell
    // which we provide and here it is bash 
    // -g is the default user flag and user will be assigned to 
    // the group u mention, always use -g flag with the 'users'
    // group, -c flag is used for providing the comments

- groups                 // this will show u that to which groups ur current user is connected too.
- sudo groupadd name_of_group           // to add the new group
- sudo groupdel name_of_group           // to delete the group
- sudo gpasswd -a user_name group_name  // assign user to a group
- sudo gpasswd -d user_name group_name // to remove user from the group
cmd -> chgrp -R groupname username // this will make changes to every folder of the username 

- login -p username // to login into system


# Monitor User ->
- who // to see how many people r logged in
- w // it is same work as 'who' but gives more detailed info related

- last // this will tell u about the every user logged in ever in system, for not whole list just unique names of all users logged
  so far use cmd -> last | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq
- finger // it is to do trace of ur user where it is coming from what kind of protocol he is using
- id username //to see uid and gid and to know whether user is existing or not

- uptime - this tells how long the system being up for and load, users etc. Screenshot(521)
- users // to list the users logged in the system
- wall // this will broadcast or msg to anyone who is logged in the linux system -??
- write username_to_send_them // it for specific user to another -??

Note -> In Linux their r 2 types of accounts ->
- local account // which is created normally with above cmds
- Domain/Directory account // when u need to add user for access to 1000 servers then we use these accounts, the client will send
  a send a request to the Directory server to authenticate and in response the server tells that the user is authenicated and allowed
  to log in, in windows their is AD(Active Directory) here u do the same as u create a Account in Active Directory of the Windows
  Server, the protocol used for this task is LDAP protocol to authenticate against a directory
Diff bw AD, LDAP, IDM, WinBIND, OpenLDAP -> https://academy.ehacking.net/courses/551622/lectures/10003046

# Types of help commands -> Screenshot(415)
- man any_cmd (this gives the manual of the cmd) // we can also use --help in the place of 'man' Ex -> any_cmd --help

- 'whatis' cmd will display short manual page discription for cmd -> whatis ls - ??

- which cmd is used to return the path name of a file or a command which we use with this 'which' cmd
- which ls //to know the location of the ls cmd
- In bash scripting it is gud practice to use the full path name as we should use -> '/bin/ls' instead of just 'ls' , bcz some
  OS recognize the 'ls' cmd and some will require u to enter the full path for the 'ls' cmd
